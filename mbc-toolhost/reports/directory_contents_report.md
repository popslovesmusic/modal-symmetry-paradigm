    *   **Summary:** Defines the fundamental "Box" primitives (Bx₀ through Bx₇) of the calculus.
*   **/definitions/tiers/**
    *   **Summary:** Contains the hierarchical layers (Tier 00 to Tier 13) of the MBC system, each with its own axiom box, operators, and other components.
*   **/docs/**
    *   **Summary:** Holds high-level documentation, encyclopedic definitions, usage guides, and master indexes for the MBC framework.
*   **/examples/**

*   **/MBC/Operators/**
    *   **Summary:** Defines specific, functional operators used within the Box Calculus (e.g., Amplify, Filter, Sum).
*   **/MBC/presets/**
    *   **Summary:** Contains pre-configured Box structures for common patterns like accumulators and filters.
*   **/MBC/schema/**
