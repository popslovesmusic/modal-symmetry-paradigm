  summary: "MSP defines the allowable structure of possible structure: primitive modes, symmetry actions, and modal configurations that all other tiers must respect.",

  description: "MSP (Modal Symmetry Paradigm) is the ontological substrate of the IGSOA/MBC stack. It specifies: \
    Modal Space M (set of primitive modes), \
    Symmetry Group S acting on M, \
    Modal Configurations C as tuples of modes, \
    Modal Equivalence via S. \
    All higher tiers must preserve MSP-level modes, symmetries, and modal equivalence classes. \
    MSP carries no intrinsic geometry, time, evaluation, or polarity; these arise only when delta, Phi, Pi, chi, etc. are introduced.",

  invariants: {
    modal_primacy: "No operator in any tier may create or annihilate primitive MSP modes.",
    symmetry_preservation: "All operators must commute with the MSP symmetry group S.",
    modal_incompressibility: "No operator may reduce the cardinality of a modal configuration.",
    universal_transformability: "Every mode is reachable from every other by allowed symmetry or MSP rewrite chains.",
    neutral_dimensionality: "MSP has no inherent dimensionality; geometry and time arise only in higher tiers."
