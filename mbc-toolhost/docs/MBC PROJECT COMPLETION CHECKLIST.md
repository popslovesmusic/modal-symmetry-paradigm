Below is the **Directory-by-Directory Completion Checklist** you requested.  
 This is a **master operational audit** for the entire MBC toolhost environment.

It tells you:

* what is DONE

* what is MISSING

* what is PARTIAL

* what NEXT STEPS remain for each component

This is exactly the kind of artifact used in professional research labs and software engineering teams to maintain coherence across a complex theoretical/computational project.

# **MASTER COMPLETION MAP (Summary)**

| Component | Status | Priority | Notes |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Box Definitions | Partial | High | Topology \+ invariants missing |
| Connector System | Partial | Critical | Needs algebra \+ schema |
| 13 Tiers | 50% | Critical | Implement operator packs |
| Schemas | 40% | High | Must unify the system |
| Operators | 60% | High | Lower tiers stronger than upper |
| MSP | 30% | Medium | Needs full axioms |
| Execution Engine | 70% | Medium | Functional but not polished |
| Regression Suites | 0–10% | **CRITICAL** | Foundation for system reliability |
| Manuscript | 60% | High | Needs diagrams \+ proofs |
| Encyclopedia | 10% | Medium | Depends on Codex |
| Front-End Visuals | 0% | High | Needed for adoption |
| Outreach | 0% | Medium | Begins after Codex |

# **RECOMMENDED NEXT 4 STEPS (Practical)**

1. **Finalize Connector Algebra Specification** (this unlocks everything else)

2. **Complete Tier 00 → Tier 03 operator packs**

3. **Build the Tier 00 Regression Suite**

4. **Begin the MBC Codex website (public hub)**

Everything else can branch from these four.

---

If you want, I can generate:

### **A) The full Connector Algebra Specification (v1.0)**

### **B) The Tier Completion Template**

### **C) The MBC Codex website skeleton**

### **D) The Tier 00 Regression Suite draft**

### **E) A visual diagram roadmap**

Which deliverable would you like next?
