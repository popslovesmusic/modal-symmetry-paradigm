# MBC AGENT TRAINING CHEAT SHEET

Operational Instructions for Learning the Monistic Box Calculus  
---

## 1\. Core Directive

An MBC-capable agent must do three things:

1. Ingest the full Tier-00 → Tier-12 library of JSON5 files.  
2. Validate all files using the official schemas.  
3. Operate using δ-Φ-Π as the primary semantic pipeline.

If the agent fails any of these, it is not MBC-capable.  
---

## 2\. The Seven Required Files per Tier

Every Tier (00–12) includes seven canonical components:

1. tier\_XX\_metadata.json5  
2. tier\_XX\_operator\_pack.json5  
3. tier\_XX\_interaction\_table.json5  
4. tier\_XX\_axiom\_box.json5  
5. tier\_XX\_rewrite\_system.json5  
6. tier\_XX\_module\_pack.json5  
7. tier\_XX\_test\_suite.json5 (mandatory)

Instruction to agent:  
Never consider a tier valid unless all 7 files are present, parsed, and schema-validated.  
---

## 3\. Foundational Operators (MSP → MBC Pipeline)

### MSP Primitives (A–E)

These describe the Modal Symmetry Paradigm, the substrate before deviation.

### Proto-Operators (Tier-00)

Define the initial modes of transformation.

### Three Pillars (Tier-01, 02, 03\)

This is the semantic pipeline the agent must internalize:

1. δ — Deviation  
   The first difference; introduces asymmetry and information.  
2. Φ — Projection  
   Maps deviation into structure, meaning, relation, or geometry.  
3. Π — Evaluation  
   Determines truth, consequence, compatibility, or causal effect.

Instruction to agent:  
Every MBC operation must express itself as a δ → Φ → Π flow, even if composed of higher-tier operators.  
---

## 4\. Operator Hierarchy (Simplified)

A quick mandatory mental map for the agent:

| Tier | Family | Core Meaning |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 00 | Proto-Primitives | Ground rules, modes, identity formers |
| 01 | δ | Deviation geometry, the seed of difference |
| 02 | Φ | Projection, semantic casting, mapping |
| 03 | Π | Evaluation, causality, truth resolution |
| 04 | μ | Local weight & adjacency |
| 05 | λ | Curvature, deformation |
| 06 | ψ | Oscillation, mode interaction |
| 07 | Σ | Summation, contraction |
| 08 | Θ | Polarity, logic routing |
| 09 | χ | Semantic evolution / time |
| 10 | Ω | Global constraints / normalization |
| 11 | ρ | Layer/meta-structure & federation |
| 12 | Ξ | Universal schema, self-diagnostic operators |

---

## 5\. Validation Rules (What the Agent Must Enforce)

### 5.1 Schema Validation

Each of the seven files must pass:

* schema\_metadata.json5  
* schema\_operator\_pack.json5  
* schema\_interaction\_table.json5  
* schema\_axiom\_box.json5  
* schema\_rewrite.json5  
* schema\_module.json5  
* schema\_test\_suite.json5

Instruction to agent:  
Reject any tier where any component fails schema validation.  
---

### 5.2 Invariant Enforcement

Each tier includes its own invariants:

* Tier-01: Deviation must increase distinguishability.  
* Tier-02: Projection must preserve semantic consistency.  
* Tier-03: Evaluation must not conflict with Ω-constraints.  
* Tier-06: ψ-operators must conserve oscillatory energy.  
* Tier-10: Ω must maintain global consistency & norm.  
* Tier-11: ρ must preserve hierarchy & federation.  
* Tier-12: Ξ must maintain universal schema closure.

Instruction to agent:  
Every operator invoked must be checked against its tier invariants before execution.  
---

## 6\. Rewrite System Rules (Absolute Requirements)

All tiers require the following meta-invariants:

1. Termination  
   No rewrite rule loops indefinitely.  
2. Confluence  
   All rewrite paths must converge to one normal form.  
3. Non-Expansion  
   No rewrite may increase semantic dimensionality.

Instruction to agent:  
Before accepting any rewrite, verify termination → confluence → non-expansion.  
---

## 7\. Interaction System

Each tier contains an interaction table defining how its operators interact with operators from other tiers.  
Instruction to agent:  
When applying any operator, consult the interaction table for compatibility and effect propagation.  
---

## 8\. The MBC Internal Reasoning Cycle

Any agent trained in MBC must reason using this loop:

1. Ingest input  
2. δ: Identify deviations  
3. Φ: Map them into structured semantic forms  
4. Π: Evaluate for truth, consistency, and causal effect  
5. Normalize with Ω  
6. Route through Θ  
7. Propagate through χ  
8. Federate under ρ  
9. Encode via Ξ if needed  
10. Return stable normal form

This becomes the agent’s default cognitive pipeline.  
---

## 9\. Test Suites—The Agent Must Self-Validate

Each tier includes a regression suite:

* Unit operator tests  
* Interaction table tests  
* Rewrite collision tests  
* Invariant tests  
* Normal form soak tests  
* Tier-12: Ξ Self-Diagnostics

Instruction to agent:  
Self-test on load and periodically during operation.  
---

## 10\. Minimum Required Knowledge for an Agent to Claim MBC Compliance

1. Understand all 13 tiers and all 91 canonical files.  
2. Validate every file with the schemas.  
3. Enforce invariants automatically.  
4. Reason using δ → Φ → Π.  
5. Use rewrite systems safely (termination \+ confluence).  
6. Normalize with Ω and federate with ρ.  
7. Pass Ξ-tests without error.

If any are missing, the agent is not MBC-trained.
