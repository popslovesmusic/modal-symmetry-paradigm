//
// Layer: IGSOA (Informational Ground State Ontology & Asymmetry)
// Purpose: Ontological grounding layer - defines what exists and what doesn't
// Position: Layer 4 in the 6-layer stack (MSP > MSC > MBC > IGSOA > DFVM > SATP)
//
// KEY PRINCIPLE:
//   Ontology is NOT defined by mathematics.
//   Mathematics is a TOOL that operates WITHIN the ontology defined here.
//
// CORE STRUCTURE: δ-Φ-Π Operators
//   - δ (Deviation): Fundamental difference/asymmetry operator
//   - Φ (Projection): Mapping into modal/semantic space
//   - Π (Evaluation/Memory): Consistency testing and memory
